# SmallSteps

**Move forward without the overwhelm.**

SmallSteps is an effort-flow planning system. It converts goals into effort containers, quietly allocates work to your day, and helps you make progress — without deadlines, guilt, or burnout.

## How It Works

```
Goal → Tasks (effort containers) → Reservoir → Daily Slice
```

1. **Add a goal** — AI breaks it into realistic effort-based tasks
2. **Effort flows** — Tasks drain over time as you work
3. **Today's plan** — A gentle daily slice, auto-generated from your reservoir

No schedules. No overdue. Just calm, consistent progress.

## Core Principles

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **Reduce overwhelm** | Show only what matters today |
| **No deadlines** | Target dates are soft, not punishing |
| **Effort-based** | Tasks have hours, not due dates |
| **Calm UI** | Minimal, quiet, no gamification |
